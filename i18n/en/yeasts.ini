This blend celebrates the strengths of California- clean, neutral fermentation, versatile usage, and adds two other strains that belong to the same 'clean/neutral' flavor category. The additional strains create complexity to the finished beer. This blend tastes more lager like than WLP001. Hop flavors and bitterness are accentuated, but not to the extreme of California. Slight sulfur will be produced during fermentation.
wlp080_cream_ale_yeast_blend_description = This is a blend of ale and lager yeast strains. The strains work together to create a clean, crisp, light American lager style ale.

wlp099_super_high_gravity_ale_yeast_description = Can ferment up to 25%% alcohol. From England. Produces ester character that increases with increasing gravity. Malt character dominates at lower gravities.
 Brewers' Notes:
 Flavors from this yeast vary greatly with the beer produced. The higher the gravity, the more winey the result. Beers over 16%% ABV begin to taste less like beer, and more like fortified wines.
 With low gravity beers, this yeast produces a nice, subtle English ale-like ester profile. As the gravity increases, some phenolic character is evident, followed by the winey-ness of beers over 16%% ABV. Most fermentations will stop between 12-16%% ABV unless these high gravity tips are performed:
 Aerate very heavily, 4 times as much as with a normal gravity beer. Less oxygen dissolves into solution at high gravity.
 Pitch 3-4 times as much yeast as normal.
 Consider aerating intermittently during the first 5 days of fermentation. This will help yeast cells during a very difficult fermentation. Aerate with oxygen for 30 seconds or air for 5-10 minutes.
 Higher nutrient levels can allow yeast to tolerate higher alcohol levels. Use 2 times the normal nutrient level. This is especially important when using WLP099 to make wine and mead, which have almost no nutrient level to begin with.Do not start with the entire wort sugar at once.
 Begin fermentation with a wort that would produce a 6-8%% beer, and add wort (it can be concentrated) each day during the first 5 days. This can be done together with aeration. This is mandatory if the reported 25%% ABV is to be achieved.

wyeast_1056_american_ale_description = Very clean, crisp flavor characteristics with low fruitness and mild ester production. A very versatile yeast for styles that desire dominant malt and hop character. This strain makes a wonderful "House" strain. Mild citrus notes develop with cooler 60-66F (15-19C) fermentations. Normally requires filtration for bright beers.
