safale_us05_description = American ale yeast producing well balanced beers with low diacetyl and a very clean, crisp end palate. Forms a firm foam head and presents a very good ability to stay in suspension during fermentation.
mangrove_us_west_coast_m44_description = A top-fermenting ale strain suitable for American style ales. This yeast produces an exceptionally clean flavor, ideal for when you want the hop character to really punch through.
 Aroma Characteristics:
 A very neutral strain even when fermented in higher gravity worts and warmer temperatures. Tangy citrus and pine hops aromas will be enhanced, as well as toasted and dark malt aromas.
 Flavor/mouthfeel characteristics:
 Beers fermented with this strain will finish dry and crisp. This strain is at its best in hop prominent American style ales. Very light ales may turn out a bit stripped, thin or astringent if care is not taken with the mash temperature and avoiding over-extraction. Acidity is moderately high, boosting hop flavors and creating a clipped finish.
 Higher alcohol beers:
 Remaining very neutral, this strain excels in strong ales with simple malt bills. Alcohol will be a dominant flavor and aroma constituent, and may be quite warming but not harsh.
wlp011_european_ale_description = Malty, Northern European-origin ale yeast. Low ester production, giving a clean profile. Little to no sulfur production. Low attenuation helps to contribute to the malty character. Good for Alt, Kolsch, malty English ales, and fruit beers.
wyeast_1056_american_ale_description = Very clean, crisp flavor characteristics with low fruitness and mild ester production. A very versatile yeast for styles that desire dominant malt and hop character. This strain makes a wonderful "House" strain. Mild citrus notes develop with cooler 60-66F (15-19C) fermentations. Normally requires filtration for bright beers.
