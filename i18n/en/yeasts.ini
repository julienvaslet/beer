safale_be256_description = Active dry yeast recommended to brew a diversity of beers amongst which abbey style beers known for their high alcohol content. It ferments very fast and reveals subtle and well-balanced aromas. To maintain the aromatic profile at the end of the fermentation, we do recommend to crop this yeast as soon as possible after fermentation.
safale_f2_description = SafAle F-2 has been selected specifically for secondary fermentation in bottle and in cask. This yeast assimilates very little maltotriose but assimi-lates basic sugars (glucose, fructose, saccharose, maltose) and is caracterized by a neutral aroma profile respecting the base beer character.
 SafAle F-2 resists to high alcohol levels (>10%% v/v) and allows brewers to obtain all the properties of refermentation:
 - Beer preservation thanks to oxygene trapping
 - Contribution in roundness and maturation aromas
 - Carbonation
 - Sticks well at the bottom of the bottles/casks and forms a nice haze when it is resuspended
 Given the impact of yeast of the quality of the final beer it is recommended to respect the recommended fermentation instructions. We strongly advise users to make fermentation trials before any commercial usage of our products.
